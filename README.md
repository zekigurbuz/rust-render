# rust-render
An (attempt at a) simple 3-D graphics rendering engine written in Rust.

Largely inspired by [Doug Milford's series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Az3jBd4xdF4&list=PLLqEtX6ql2EyPAZ1M2_C0GgVd4A-_L4_5) (learning about Rust) and [javidx9's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrOv9FMX8xJE8NgepZR1etrsU63fDDGxO) (learning about linear algebra).
